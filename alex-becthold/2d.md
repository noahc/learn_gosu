Developing a 2-D game as opposed to a3-D game presents some interesting
challenges and opportunities that you wouldn't otherwise recieve.  It also gives you
some obvious options for how to make your game, or at least, how to make it look.
You could make your game top-down, which means you will have a view from straight
above rather than from the side or a first-person view.  One game that comes to mind
with this perspective is frogger.  Another perspective we could give our game is a
side-scrolling game, such as Super Mario.  We could also give our game a sort of 3-D
perspective by using a viewpoint from the back that would be very useful in something
such as a racing game.  But whatever we decide to use, each choice provides its own
unique challenges and opportunities.
