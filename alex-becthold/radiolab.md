I always used to thimk that a game was simply a way to relax and enjoy yourself in you leisure time.  But more than that, I thought it was also a way to escape the world and the stress it presents you for a little while.  This episode of RadioLab smashes my ideas of what a game is and what it really means.  While I wasn't necessarily wrong, I was pidgeon-holing the idea of what a game can be.  It can be a form of expression, just as a piece of art can be.  It can be a way to tell a story in a way that only a game can: interactively.  It can give you a new perspective on the story, such was the case in the podcast, by putting you in the story itself.  By letting you be a part of it rather than just being told the story.
