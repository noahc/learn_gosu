### Questions

The questions below are intentionally open ended. As with most things in life, there is no
right answer. However, be as thorough and concise as possible.

1. Please listen to RadioLab's latest podcast found at
   http://www.radiolab.org/story/cathedral/.  This RadioLab episode challenges
what it means to call a computer program a game. After listening to this, in
what ways have your thoughts about what a 'game' is changed? What does it mean
to be a 'game'.

2. The games we'll be building are limited to being 2D (as opposed to 3d). What does this mean for
   the games we develop? What are the constraints? Could these constraints be
useful to us? How so?

3. We've been challenged to think about what it means for something to be a
   game by the Radiolab episode. We've also had to think about the constraints
we'll face as we build our game. Now is the time to start thinking about the
type(s) of games we'll be building once we're done with the book. You don't have
to write down anything (yet!) but start thinking about the story line for a
game. As a class we'll have to decide on one to pursue.

4. Once we've pursued a vision, we'll release the game into the world for others
   to play. Let's imagine this game becomes a viral sensation and millions of
people are playing this game. One small problem, we've used some assets (sounds,
videos, images) we didn't have a license for and now we've just received a legal
notice that we have to take our game off line. Explain to me what copyright is
briefly, how it affects our ability to use assets in our game and somethings we
should do as we build this game to make sure we don't get in trouble. 

As a bonus, If you find this topic interesting, research Creative Commons
licenses. Integrate that new found knowledge into your pull request above.
