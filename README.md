# learn_gosu

This class is designed to give you the skills you need to develop games and more
broadly to program software. After taking this course, you won't know how to do
everything related to programming, but you will be given the tools to figure
that out.

# Modules

This class will be broken down into several modules. As the class progresses
more modules will be added. When I add a new module or new content, I will open
a pull request for your comment. Please review this pull request, make comments,
and give a +1 if you have no concerns or questions.
